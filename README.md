# metawear_sampleApp_cpp

A sample c++ windows application for metawear board. 
It is almost the same code as the C# Wrapper released by mbientlab here https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-CSharpWrapper, but with the use of C++ API directly in Universal Windows Application. 

Requirements: Windows 10, Visual Studio Community 2015.
